  "body": "### Welcome to Nofollow-Check.\r\n\r\nNofollow-check is a very small JavaScript that can be run to detect any external-pointing hyperlinks on a page which are missing the rel=\"nofollow\" attribute.\r\n\r\nSetting rel=\"nofollow\" is beneficial for search engine optimisation.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nSimply paste the below code into your browser console:\r\n\r\n`    var s = document.createElement('script');\r\n    s.src = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuelmac/nofollow-check/master/nofollow-check.min.js';\r\n    document.querySelector('body').appendChild(s);`\r\n\r\nAny links missing the appropriate rel tag will then log themselves out into the console for you to see.\r\n\r\n### Permanent reporting\r\nYou can of course link directly to the JavaScript file reference above via a script tag on your page, however this is ill-advised for production websites. Every page log will log information to the console.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n* No jQuery required.\r\n* Vanilla JavaScript.\r\n* Just requires any new browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE9+) with a developer console.",
